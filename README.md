Scheduler 1.1.1
=========
Assists in scheduling and keeping track of events/appointments/meetings.
I made this because programs such as google calendar fail to display upcoming events in such a way where it is easy to plan when to do homework/projects/whatever..

Event data is stored in events.json which is stored in the binary's directory.
